A Deep-dive into data structures and algorithms in C# and Java


## Asymptotic Analysis
This is a method of describing limiting behaviour. 

As an illustration, suppose that we are interested in the  properties of a function f(n) as n becomes very large. Hence , if f(n) = n^2 + 3n then as 'n' becomes very large, then 3n becomes insignificant and you can state that f(n) asymptotically equivalent to n^2 (other words ignore the constant). Otherwise represented as f(n) ~ n^2 .

Also, in Asymptotic analysis, we always talk about input sizes larger than a constant value. It might be possible that those large inputs are never given to your software and an algorithm which is asymptotically slower, always performs better for your particular situation. So, you may end up choosing an algorithm that is Asymptotically slower but faster for your software.
